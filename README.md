### DSA 210: Analyzing Factors Influencing Electric Vehicle Adoption Across U.S. States
*** Çağrı KARAKAŞ 33916 ***

I am Çağrı Karakaş. My student number is 33916. I am a Data Science and Analytics major at Sabancı University. This repository documents my DSA210 Term Project where I am going to investigate electric vehicle adoption rates and the reasons behind these rates by analyzing USA data.

## 1. Introduction ##

***The Rise of Electric Vehicles(EVs)***

The move toward electric vehicles has marked an incredible shift in personal transportation, motivated by goals like lowering greenhouse gas emissions, lessening fossil fuel usage, and enhancing urban air quality. In recent years, EV technology has progressed significantly, as battery prices have decreased and driving distances have expanded, making them a more logical choice for drivers to prefer, producers to manufacture, and governments to promote.

Governments and producers are making significant investments to electrification in transportation throughout the globe. Nevertheless, the actual preference of EVs among consumers is not consistent and uniform. Examining various places, such as the states in the US, shows considerably different rates of electric vehicle adoption among the public sphere.

Common knowledge and current studies indicate several major elements affecting this trend: the initial expense of EVs cmpared to conventional vehicles, the accessibility and quantity of charging points, governmental incentives, charging costs, and also consumer vision and awareness on the environment. The United States presents a notably fascinating opportunity for study because of the access to comprehensive state-level data on numerous potential influences, and clear indications of distinct differences in adoption rates across various states. Although we may anticipate that states which have more economic prosperity stricter environmental policies will take the lead, the actual situation is mostly more complicated. This situation intends to apply data science and analytical methods to investigate these cases.

## 2. Project Idea ##

It is known that electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more and more common. However, when you check the relevant data and statistics, some states seem to be far ahead while others fall behind in EV adoption. It’s easy to assume that wealthier states or those with more public charging stations tend to have more EVs. Still, I’m curious about the states that don’t follow this simple trend. Why might a state with an average income have a surprisingly high number of EVs? Or why might a wealthy state have fewer than expected? 

This project will examine state-level data to see which factors—money, infrastructure, socioeconomic and sociocultural levels of people, environmental situations—really can explain the difference in EV adoption rates. Specifically, states that stand out, whether they are performing much better or worse than a basic and predictable model would suggest, and possible reasons for these differences will be investigated in this project.

***Core Question***

What other criteria, beside from the basic ones, such as affluence and the availability of chargers, contribute to the explanation of why certain US states exhibit markedly higher or lower adoption rates of electric vehicles than others?

## 3. Motivation ##

The drive for electric cars is more than simply a trend; it's a cruical part of solving more ceomprehensive global issues like air pollution and climate change. Identifying what factors, other than price or charger availability, truly motivate people to purchase EVs is a difficult task with significant challenge not only for government policies but also business strategies. Since working in business analytics department in the future is in one of my plans for the future, I thought this project could be a nice starting point.

In addition to the usefulness; I am not educated well enough in this subject, so I'm actually interested in the trends and. Are financial incentives and charging stations the only factors influencing EV adoption, or do other factors like population education, population density, or even air quality have a big impact? It seems like apuzzle to solve using statistics why some states appear to adopt EVs at a faster rate than others. It's an opportunity to determine whether the evidence confirms widely held opinions or perhaps provides a more complex picture.

Moreover; this subject is a up-to-date topic, so it seemed to me like a suitable and interesting choice to apply the modeling and data analysis methods that I am currently learning in DSA210. Also; thanks to the abundance of publicly available data on the topic i prefered US states as the reference place.
